Geophysical Surveys
--------------------

Types
.....

Geophysical surveys play a significant role in offshore geotechnical site investigation by providing non-intrusive methods for mapping and characterizing subsurface geological features. These surveys utilize different technologies to capture data about the composition and structure of the sub-seabed layers.

1. Seismic Profiling:

Seismic profiling is a widely used geophysical technique that involves sending acoustic waves into the seabed and measuring their reflection. The resulting data help create images of subsurface structures, including sediment layers and geological formations. This information is crucial for understanding the overall geological setting and identifying potential hazards such as faults or gas pockets.

2. Side-Scan Sonar:

Side-scan sonar employs acoustic signals to produce detailed images of the seabed. By detecting variations in the acoustic return signals, it provides high-resolution imagery of the seabed topography. This technology is invaluable for identifying features such as sand waves, rock outcrops, debris, and even archaeological artifacts. Side-scan sonar contributes to the overall seabed mapping and aids in route planning for pipelines and cables.

3. Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES):

Multibeam echo sounder technology utilizes a fan-shaped acoustic beam to capture a swath of the seabed. By measuring the time taken for the sound waves to return, it generates detailed bathymetric maps with high spatial resolution. MBES is particularly useful for mapping the seafloor morphology, identifying underwater geological features, and ensuring precise positioning of structures.

4. Sub-Bottom Profiling:

Sub-bottom profiling involves sending acoustic pulses into the seabed and recording the reflections from different layers beneath the seafloor. This technique provides insights into the sub-seabed stratigraphy, helping to identify sediment layers, bedrock, and potential geohazards. Sub-bottom profiling is crucial for understanding the geological conditions below the seabed and contributes to the overall site characterization.

5. Electromagnetic Surveys:

Electromagnetic surveys help in mapping the electrical conductivity of the sub-seabed, providing information about the presence of fluids, variations in soil composition, or the potential presence of buried objects. This is particularly useful for detecting anomalies and understanding the geological environment.

6. Borehole Logging:

Borehole logging provides detailed information about the soil and rock layers beneath the seabed. Parameters like soil type, color, and composition are recorded to create a stratigraphic profile. Logging is often done during or after drilling operations to complement sample data.

1. Identifying Subsurface Structures:

Seismic profiling, side-scan sonar, and sub-bottom profiling help identify subsurface structures, providing valuable information about sedimentary layers, bedrock, and geological formations.

2. Mapping Seabed Topography:

Side-scan sonar and multibeam echo sounder assist in mapping the seabed topography with high resolution, aiding in the identification of potential areas for foundation placement, cable and pipeline routing, and ensuring safe construction practices.

3. Detecting Hazards and Anomalies:

Geophysical surveys, including seismic profiling and electromagnetic surveys, aid in detecting potential hazards such as faults, gas pockets, or geological anomalies. Identifying these features is essential for assessing risks to the stability and safety of offshore structures.

4. Providing Input for Seabed Characterization:

The data obtained from geophysical surveys contribute to the overall seabed characterization. This information, combined with geotechnical data, offers a more comprehensive understanding of the site conditions for engineering design.




Geotechnical Surveys
--------------------

1. Seabed Sampling

Geotechnical surveys often commence with seabed sampling techniques such as drilling, coring, or grabbing. These methods help retrieve samples from the seabed, which are subsequently analyzed to understand soil properties.

2. In Situ Testing

In situ testing involves conducting tests directly in the seabed to determine properties such as soil strength, density, and stiffness. Cone penetration testing (CPT) and T-bar testing are common in situ testing methods.

- Cone Penetration Testing (CPT)

CPT involves pushing a conical penetrometer into the seabed at a constant rate. The resistance encountered by the cone is measured and used to assess soil properties, including strength and stratigraphy. CPT provides continuous data along the depth of penetration, aiding in detailed soil profiling.

- T-Bar Testing

T-bar testing, also known as T-bar penetrometry, involves pushing a T-shaped bar into the seabed to measure the resistance. It provides information about the soil's shear strength and compressibility, helping in the assessment of foundation design suitability.

3. Sampling for Laboratory Testing

Collected seabed samples, obtained through coring or drilling, are transported to onshore laboratories for further testing. Laboratory tests include analyzing soil characteristics, shear strength, consolidation properties, and other parameters critical for foundation design.

4. Box Core, Piston Core, and Jumbo Piston Core

Core sampling methods, including box core, piston core, and jumbo piston core, are employed to collect undisturbed sediment samples from the seabed. These samples are particularly valuable for studying sedimentary structures, understanding sedimentation rates, and analyzing the depositional history of the site.

  - Box Core

Box core sampling is a non-invasive method that captures a relatively large, intact section of the seabed. It is useful for studying surface sediments and benthic organisms.

  - Piston Core

Piston coring involves driving a tube into the seabed with a piston to retrieve a continuous sediment core. This method is effective for collecting deeper sediment layers and preserving stratigraphic sequences.

  - Jumbo Piston Core

Jumbo piston coring is similar to piston coring but is designed for retrieving longer and larger-diameter cores. It is employed for deep-sea research and obtaining extended sediment records.
