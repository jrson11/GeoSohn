FAQ for shallow foundation
...........................

  - API RP 2GEO-7.15 used internal soil friction angle (phi'), but also mentioned different angle (delta) between the foundation soil and the structure. How can we estimate delta?
  - API RP 2GEO-7.16 mentioned torsional stability, but has no equation. How can we check torsional stability?
